# Can dark-skinned people get melanoma?

Melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, can affect anyone, regardless of skin color. While it's true that people with darker skin tones have a lower overall risk compared to those with lighter skin, the disease often presents at a later, more advanced stage in this population, leading to poorer outcomes.

## Why Melanoma Awareness is Crucial for Everyone

It's vital for individuals with all skin types to be aware of melanoma risks, symptoms, and prevention methods. Understanding the nuances of how melanoma appears in darker skin can significantly improve early detection and treatment success.

### Where Melanoma Tends to Appear in Darker Skin

In individuals with darker skin, melanoma is frequently found in less sun-exposed areas:

*   **Palms of hands and soles of feet:** This is known as acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM).
*   **Under the nails:** This is a subungual melanoma.
*   **Mucous membranes:** Such as inside the mouth, nose, or genitals.

### Recognizing Melanoma: The ABCDEs

The ABCDEs of melanoma are helpful for everyone, but it's important to note that these features can be less obvious in darker skin:

*   **Asymmetry:** One half of the mole doesn't match the other half.
*   **Border:** The edges are irregular, blurred, or ragged.
*   **Color:** The color is uneven and may include shades of black, brown, or tan. In darker skin, it can sometimes be skin-colored or amelanotic (lacking pigment).
*   **Diameter:** The mole is usually larger than 6mm (about the size of a pencil eraser), although melanomas can be smaller.
*   **Evolving:** The mole is changing in size, shape, color, or elevation, or a new symptom, such as bleeding, itching, or crusting, develops.

## Myth vs. Fact

**Myth:** People with dark skin don't get melanoma.

**Fact:** While less common, melanoma can occur in individuals with darker skin tones. It's often diagnosed at a later stage, making it more dangerous.

## Prevention and Early Detection

Sun protection, even for those with darker skin, is essential:

*   **Seek shade** during peak sun hours (10 AM to 4 PM).
*   **Wear protective clothing**, including long sleeves, pants, and wide-brimmed hats.
*   **Use broad-spectrum sunscreen** with an SPF of 30 or higher on all exposed skin, even on cloudy days.
*   **Perform regular self-exams** of your skin, paying close attention to the palms, soles, and under the nails.
*   **See a dermatologist** for regular skin checks, especially if you have a family history of melanoma or notice any suspicious moles.

Early detection and prompt treatment are critical for improving survival rates for all skin types. Don't hesitate to consult a dermatologist if you have any concerns about a mole or skin lesion.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is melanoma more aggressive in people with darker skin?

While not inherently more aggressive, melanoma is often diagnosed at a later stage in individuals with darker skin, which can lead to poorer outcomes.

### What causes melanoma in areas that are not exposed to the sun?

The causes of acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM) and subungual melanoma, often found in less sun-exposed areas, are not entirely understood but are thought to involve genetic factors and other unknown environmental influences.

### How often should people with darker skin get skin checks?

The frequency of skin checks should be determined in consultation with a dermatologist, considering factors such as family history, personal risk factors, and any suspicious moles. Annual checks are often recommended.

### Can tanning beds cause melanoma in people with darker skin?

Yes, tanning beds significantly increase the risk of melanoma, regardless of skin tone. They should be avoided.
