# Can actinic keratosis turn into cancer?

Actinic keratoses (AKs), also known as solar keratoses, are rough, scaly patches on the skin that develop from years of sun exposure. Itâ€™s natural to worry about whether these common skin lesions can turn into skin cancer. Let's delve into what you need to know.

## What are Actinic Keratoses?

*   AKs are considered precancerous growths.
*   They usually appear on areas of the body frequently exposed to the sun, such as the face, scalp, ears, neck, hands, and arms.
*   They feel dry and rough and can range in color from skin-toned to red, pink, or brown.
*   AKs are a sign of sun damage and indicate an increased risk of developing skin cancer.

### Recognizing Actinic Keratosis: Symptoms to Watch For

*   Rough, dry, scaly patches of skin.
*   Patches that may be flat or slightly raised.
*   Size typically less than 1 inch in diameter.
*   Possible itching, burning, or stinging sensation.
*   Location on sun-exposed areas.

## Actinic Keratosis and Skin Cancer: The Link

*   While not all AKs turn into cancer, they are considered precancerous.
*   The most common type of skin cancer AKs can develop into is squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).
*   The risk of an individual AK turning into SCC is relatively low. However, because many people have multiple AKs, the overall risk increases.
*   Early detection and treatment of AKs can help prevent the development of skin cancer.

### Risk Factors for Progression to Cancer

*   Number of AKs: The more AKs you have, the higher your risk.
*   Location: AKs on the lips or ears have a higher risk of turning into SCC.
*   Suppressed immune system: Individuals with weakened immune systems are at greater risk.
*   History of skin cancer: Previous skin cancer increases your risk.

## Treatment Options for Actinic Keratosis

*   **Cryotherapy:** Freezing the AK with liquid nitrogen.
*   **Topical Creams:** Applying creams like fluorouracil or imiquimod.
*   **Chemical Peels:** Using chemical solutions to remove the damaged skin.
*   **Photodynamic Therapy (PDT):** Using a photosensitizing agent and light to destroy the AKs.
*   **Surgical Excision:** Cutting out the AK.
*   **Laser Treatment:** Using lasers to remove the AKs.

## Prevention and Early Detection

*   **Sun Protection:** Wear sunscreen daily with an SPF of 30 or higher, wear protective clothing, and avoid peak sun hours.
*   **Regular Skin Exams:** Perform self-exams regularly and see a dermatologist for professional skin exams, especially if you have a history of sun exposure or AKs.
*   **Early Treatment:** Don't ignore suspicious skin changes. Early treatment of AKs is crucial in preventing skin cancer.

## Myth vs. Fact

*   **Myth:** Actinic keratoses are just age spots and nothing to worry about.
*   **Fact:** Actinic keratoses are precancerous growths that need medical attention.
*   **Myth:** If an AK doesn't bother me, I don't need to treat it.
*   **Fact:** Even if an AK is asymptomatic, treatment is recommended to prevent potential progression to skin cancer.
*   **Myth:** Sunscreen is only needed on sunny days.
*   **Fact:** UV rays can penetrate clouds, so sunscreen is important even on cloudy days.

## Conclusion

Actinic keratoses are a common skin condition resulting from sun exposure and carry a risk of developing into skin cancer. Early detection, treatment, and diligent sun protection are essential for preventing progression to squamous cell carcinoma. Consult with a dermatologist for diagnosis and appropriate treatment options.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What happens if an actinic keratosis is left untreated?

If left untreated, an actinic keratosis can potentially develop into squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a type of skin cancer.

### Can actinic keratosis go away on its own?

While some AKs might resolve on their own, it's not guaranteed, and it's best to have them evaluated and treated by a dermatologist to prevent any potential progression to skin cancer.

### How often should I get my skin checked if I have actinic keratosis?

Your dermatologist will recommend a follow-up schedule based on your individual risk factors, but generally, regular skin exams every 6-12 months are recommended.

### Is actinic keratosis contagious?

No, actinic keratosis is not contagious. It is caused by sun damage and is not spread from person to person.

### What does it feel like when an AK is turning into cancer?

It can be difficult to tell. Changes in size, bleeding, ulceration, or increased tenderness or pain in an AK could indicate progression to skin cancer and warrant immediate medical attention.
