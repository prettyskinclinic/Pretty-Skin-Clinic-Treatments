# Can exercise worsen hives?

It's frustrating enough to deal with hives, also known as urticaria, but what happens when your workout seems to trigger them? The connection between exercise and hives is more common than you might think, and understanding the relationship can help you manage your symptoms.

## What are Hives and How do they Look?

Hives are raised, itchy welts that appear on the skin. They can vary in size from small spots to large patches and often appear suddenly.

*   They can be red, pink, or skin-colored.
*   They usually itch intensely.
*   Hives can appear anywhere on the body.
*   Individual hives typically disappear within 24 hours, but new ones may continue to appear.

## Exercise-Induced Urticaria (EIU): The Connection

Exercise-induced urticaria (EIU) is a specific type of hives triggered by physical activity.

### Symptoms of EIU

*   Itching, flushing, and warmth of the skin during or after exercise.
*   Hives (raised, itchy welts) appearing on the skin.
*   In some cases, more severe symptoms like dizziness, wheezing, or even anaphylaxis can occur.

### What Causes EIU?

The exact cause is not always clear, but some factors may play a role:

*   **Food-dependent EIU:** Eating certain foods before exercising can trigger hives. Common culprits include shellfish, wheat, and nuts.
*   **Cholinergic Urticaria:** This type is triggered by an increase in body temperature, which can happen during exercise.
*   **Idiopathic EIU:** In some cases, no specific trigger can be identified.

### When to See a Doctor

Seek immediate medical attention if you experience:

*   Difficulty breathing or swallowing.
*   Dizziness or lightheadedness.
*   Swelling of the face, lips, or tongue.

## Myth vs. Fact

**Myth:** Exercise is always bad for hives.

**Fact:** Exercise can *trigger* hives in some people, but not everyone with hives will experience this. In some cases, regular exercise can improve overall health and potentially reduce the frequency of hives in the long run by managing stress.

## Managing Exercise-Induced Hives

Here are some steps you can take to manage EIU:

*   **Identify triggers:** Keep a food and exercise diary to track what you eat and when you exercise to see if you can identify any specific triggers.
*   **Avoid triggers:** Once you know what triggers your hives, avoid those foods or activities before exercising.
*   **Take antihistamines:** Antihistamines can help to relieve itching and reduce the severity of hives. Take them *before* exercising if you know you are prone to EIU.
*   **Exercise in a cool environment:** High temperatures can exacerbate hives.
*   **Stay hydrated:** Dehydration can also worsen hives.
*   **Talk to your doctor:** They may recommend other treatments, such as epinephrine auto-injectors, if you have a history of severe reactions.

## Conclusion

While exercise can trigger hives in some individuals, it's important to understand the specific type of hives (EIU) and identify any underlying triggers. By taking preventive measures and working closely with your doctor, you can manage your symptoms and continue to enjoy the benefits of exercise.
