# Can HPV vaccines prevent warts?

HPV vaccines are known for their ability to prevent certain cancers, but can they also protect against those pesky warts? The answer is a bit more nuanced than a simple yes or no, so let's dive into the details.

## What are Warts and How are they Caused?

Warts are skin growths caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). There are many different types of HPV, and some are more likely to cause warts than others.

*   **Common warts:** Usually appear on hands and fingers.
*   **Plantar warts:** Found on the soles of the feet.
*   **Genital warts:** Occur on the genitals, in the pubic area, or in the anus.
*   **Flat warts:** Can grow on the face, neck, or back of the hands.

## How HPV Vaccines Work Against Warts

HPV vaccines work by stimulating the immune system to produce antibodies that target specific types of HPV. These antibodies prevent infection from those HPV types.

### Types of HPV Vaccines and Wart Coverage

The HPV vaccines available are: Gardasil 9, Gardasil, and Cervarix.

*   **Gardasil 9** protects against 9 HPV types (6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58). Types 6 and 11 cause about 90% of genital warts.
*   **Gardasil** (no longer widely available) protected against HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18.
*   **Cervarix** protects against HPV types 16 and 18, which are major causes of cervical cancer, but it does *not* protect against the HPV types that cause warts.

### Effectiveness of HPV Vaccines in Preventing Warts

Because Gardasil 9 targets the HPV types most commonly responsible for genital warts (types 6 and 11), itâ€™s very effective at preventing them when administered before exposure to HPV. Studies have shown that the vaccine can reduce the risk of genital warts by up to 90%.

## Myth vs. Fact

**Myth:** HPV vaccines only prevent cancer.

**Fact:** While HPV vaccines are excellent at preventing certain cancers, they also protect against genital warts caused by specific HPV types covered by the vaccine.

## Conclusion

HPV vaccines, particularly Gardasil 9, are a powerful tool in preventing genital warts. Vaccination is most effective when administered before the onset of sexual activity.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does the HPV vaccine treat existing warts?

No, the HPV vaccine is preventative. It helps prevent *new* infections but does not treat existing warts. If you already have warts, you'll need to explore treatment options with a dermatologist.

### Who should get the HPV vaccine?

The CDC recommends HPV vaccination for all adolescents (both boys and girls) starting at age 11 or 12. It is also recommended for adults up to age 26 who were not adequately vaccinated when younger. Some adults aged 27 through 45 may decide to get the HPV vaccine after speaking with their doctor, based on their risk of new HPV infections.

### Are there any side effects of the HPV vaccine?

The HPV vaccine is very safe. Common side effects are mild and include pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site, as well as fever, headache, or fatigue. Serious side effects are rare.

### Can I still get warts even if I'm vaccinated?

While the HPV vaccine is highly effective, it doesn't protect against *all* types of HPV that can cause warts. It also does not protect against HPV infections acquired *before* vaccination. It's important to continue practicing safe sex and get regular check-ups with your doctor.
