# Are genital warts the same as common warts?

Genital warts and common warts are both caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), but they are *not* the same. They differ in the HPV types that cause them, where they appear on the body, and how they are treated.

## Understanding Genital Warts

Genital warts are a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by specific types of HPV. They typically appear in the genital area, anus, or inner thighs.

### Symptoms of Genital Warts

*   Small, flesh-colored or gray swellings in your genital area.
*   Several warts close together that may take on a cauliflower-like shape.
*   Itching or discomfort in your genital area.
*   Bleeding with intercourse (rare).

### Causes of Genital Warts

Genital warts are spread through skin-to-skin contact, most often during vaginal, anal, or oral sex with someone who has the virus.

### Treatment Options for Genital Warts

There are various treatments available for genital warts, which aim to remove the warts. These include:

*   **Topical medications:** Creams or solutions prescribed by your doctor that you apply directly to the warts.
*   **Cryotherapy:** Freezing the warts off with liquid nitrogen.
*   **Electrocautery:** Burning the warts off with an electric current.
*   **Laser therapy:** Using a laser to destroy the warts.
*   **Surgical removal:** Cutting the warts off.

## Understanding Common Warts

Common warts, on the other hand, are usually found on the hands, fingers, and feet. While also caused by HPV, different types of HPV are responsible for common warts.

### Symptoms of Common Warts

*   Small, fleshy, grainy bumps
*   Usually painless but can be painful when located on a weight-bearing area.
*   Rough to the touch.
*   May have black pinpoints (clotted blood vessels).

### Causes of Common Warts

Common warts spread through direct contact with someone who has the virus or by touching something that has the virus on it (e.g., shared towels or surfaces).

### Treatment Options for Common Warts

*   **Salicylic acid:** Over-the-counter or prescription topical treatments that peel away the wart.
*   **Cryotherapy:** Freezing the wart off.
*   **Cantharidin:** A topical medication applied by a doctor that causes a blister under the wart, eventually killing it.
*   **Surgical removal:** Cutting the wart off (less common for common warts).

## Myth vs. Fact

**Myth:** All HPV infections cause warts.
**Fact:** Many HPV infections clear on their own without causing any symptoms. Only certain types of HPV cause warts.

**Myth:** You can only get genital warts from sexual activity.
**Fact:** While most genital wart infections are spread through sexual contact, it's possible, though rare, to spread them through other forms of skin-to-skin contact.

## Conclusion

While both genital and common warts are caused by HPV, they are distinct conditions. Genital warts are sexually transmitted and require specific medical attention. Common warts are generally harmless and found in non-genital areas. Knowing the difference is essential for appropriate management and prevention.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What happens if genital warts are left untreated?

Left untreated, genital warts may remain the same, grow, or resolve on their own. However, untreated warts can continue to spread the virus to others. In rare cases, certain types of HPV associated with genital warts can increase the risk of cervical cancer in women, which is why regular screening is so important.

### Can I prevent genital warts?

Yes! The HPV vaccine is highly effective in preventing infection with the types of HPV that cause most genital warts and certain cancers. Using condoms during sexual activity can also lower your risk of transmission.

### Can I get genital warts from a toilet seat?

It's extremely unlikely to contract genital warts from a toilet seat. HPV needs direct skin-to-skin contact to spread.

### How long does it take for genital warts to appear after exposure?

The incubation period for genital warts can range from a few weeks to several months after exposure to HPV.
